# RPS-Tournament Rapid Prototype


## How to use the Application
*Note This only works on one machine, because all clients are connecting to the same IP address (localhost)*
- First run Server.java
- Once you have your server running, you are going to want to run an instance of Client
- Then run another instance of Client
- You will get a message on both instances of Client, prompting you to enter a choice of either R, P, or S to play.
- After the game ends, both Clients are disconnected, and will provide an output of the winner. 
- The Server will then output that it is looking for new players.
